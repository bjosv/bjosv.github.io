# Building and distributing

## Update sites

There are three update sites:

-   `http://download.erlide.org/update` : contains all stable releases
-   `http://download.erlide.org/update/beta` : contains the release the will be
    promoted to stable once it passes acceptance tests. May be broken at
    times, but not for long.
-   `http://download.erlide.org/update/nightly` : contains the latest and
    greatest, but untested code. Use it at your own risk.

## Building Erlide

** This part is outdated **

Building is done using Maven and Tycho.

For headless builds, the `org.erlide.releng` project contains all the
necessary scripts and more detailed information. To drive the builds,
there are is a `Rakefile` script (so you need to have jruby and rake
installed) which more or less calls Ant with `build.ant`.

The Ant script can install Buckminster and there is also a
`setup_tools.sh` script that will install java, ant, otp R15 and jruby
in your home directory. (JRuby is used because it had seamless integration with Ant)

### Build target

The target is installed automatically by the scripts, if itâ€™s not
already there. It will be put in `~/erlide_tools/target.platform` so
that it can be reused.

### Automatic builds

We have a [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org) server set up to do automatic
builds, at `http://ci.erlide.org`. Here we will run automated tests and
stable releases can be published to the official update sites from here
too.

#### Jenkins jobs

There are a number of jobs that roughly correspond to the different
build tasks.

-   **build_pu**, **build_beta**, **build_master**: these are running the test suite on
    the respective branches from the repo (pu, release, master)
-   **p2\_site**: if the tests are successful, a p2 update site is
    created
-   **publish\_site**: picks a p2 update site and makes it available on
    the web. `pu` is published automatically to `nightly`, while `beta`
    and `master` are published manually by promoting the respective
    builds
-   **publish\_product**: puts together an Eclipse-based erlide product
    and publishes it. Only from `master` and is manually started after
    acceptance tests.
